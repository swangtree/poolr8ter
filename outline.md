# Poolr8ter 🎱 — V2 Blueprint: Full-Stack with Supabase

*A revised project plan focused on building a robust, scalable, and feature-rich application for a competitive pool league.*

---

## 1 · Project Goal (Revised)

> **Build** a full-stack web application that provides user authentication, a persistent ELO-based leaderboard, personal match histories, and a dynamic rulebook.
> **Foundation** will be built on a scalable architecture to support future features like seasons, tournaments, and richer UI/UX.
> **Tech Stack:**
> • **Frontend:** Static HTML, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js (Hosted on GitHub Pages)
> • **Backend:** Cloudflare Worker in TypeScript for API logic.
> • **Database & Auth:** **Supabase** for the Postgres database and user authentication (JWT-based).

---

## 2 · Architecture (Revised)

The new architecture separates concerns for scalability and feature depth.

          └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────► 7. Authenticate User
```

**Flow:**
1.  The user's browser loads the static front-end from GitHub Pages.
2.  When a user logs in or signs up, the front-end communicates directly with the Supabase Auth endpoint.
3.  Upon successful login, Supabase returns a JSON Web Token (JWT).
4.  For all subsequent API requests (like reporting a match), the front-end sends this JWT in the `Authorization` header to the Cloudflare Worker.
5.  The Worker validates the JWT using Supabase's public key and, if valid, executes the business logic, querying the Supabase Postgres database.

---

## 3 · Database Schema (Postgres)

The data will be stored in a relational Postgres database managed by Supabase. This structure enables efficient querying for leaderboards, match histories, and user data.

### 3.1 `players` Table
Stores all information about a unique player.

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  elo INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1200,
  -- Supabase Auth handles user details, this links to it.
  -- The 'id' column here will be the same as the user's ID in Supabase's 'auth.users' table.
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### 3.2 `matches` Table
Stores all information about a single game, linking back to the players involved.

```sql
CREATE TABLE matches (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  player1_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  player2_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),
  winner_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES players(id),

  player1_elo_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
  player1_elo_after INTEGER NOT NULL,
  player2_elo_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
  player2_elo_after INTEGER NOT NULL,

  played_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  -- Ensure a player cannot play against themselves
  CONSTRAINT check_players_not_same CHECK (player1_id <> player2_id)
);
```

---

## 4 · API Endpoints (Revised)

The Cloudflare Worker will handle all business logic. All endpoints that require a logged-in user will be protected and expect a valid Supabase JWT.

### `POST /report`
Reports the result of a new match.
*   **Auth:** Required. Expects `Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_JWT>`.
*   **Body:** `{ "opponent_id": "...", "winner_id": "..." }`
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate the JWT to get the reporting player's ID.
    2.  Fetch ELOs for both players from the `players` table.
    3.  Calculate new ELO ratings.
    4.  Insert a new row into the `matches` table with all details.
    5.  Update the `elo` column for both players in the `players` table.

### `GET /leaderboard`
Fetches the player leaderboard.
*   **Auth:** Not required.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  `SELECT username, elo FROM players ORDER BY elo DESC;`
    2.  Returns a sorted JSON array of players.

### `GET /matches`
Fetches the match history for the logged-in user.
*   **Auth:** Required. Expects `Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_JWT>`.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate JWT to get the user's ID.
    2.  Query the `matches` table where `player1_id` or `player2_id` matches the user's ID.
    3.  Join with the `players` table to get opponent usernames.
    4.  Return a JSON array of match details.

## 5 · Front-End UI (Revised)

The UI is a single-page application (`index.html`) built with Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js for interactivity.

### 5.1 Design & Aesthetic
*   **Inspiration:** The design is inspired by the minimalist, data-driven interface of *Monkeytype* combined with a retro "80s After Dark" color theme.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Background: Dark Navy (`#1b1d36`)
    *   Primary Accent / Text: Soft Pink (`#fca6d1`)
    *   Secondary Text: Off-White (`#e1e7eb`)
    *   Highlights: Pastel Blue (`#99d6ea`) and Daffodil Yellow (`#ffe9a1`)
*   **Typography:**
    *   Primary Font: `Inter` (sans-serif)
    *   Data/Numbers: `JetBrains Mono` (monospaced) for alignment.

### 5.2 Current Status
*   A static visual prototype (`index.html`) has been created on the `bolt` branch.
*   This prototype includes the full page layout, tab navigation, and a placeholder leaderboard table that matches the target design.
*   Basic tab-switching functionality is implemented with vanilla JavaScript.

### 5.3 Auth Flow
*   **Public Access:** Users can view the `Leaderboard` and `Rules` tabs without logging in.
*   **Login Prompt:** Clicking on `Home/Track`, `Matches`, or `Account` will trigger a login/signup modal.

### 5.4 Authentication Strategy
*   **Primary Method:** Social login via Google will be the main authentication method for users. This requires setting up an OAuth application in the Google Cloud Console and adding the Client ID and Secret to the Supabase dashboard.
*   **Anonymous/Demo Access:** To allow for easy previewing (e.g., by recruiters), an "anonymous" or "demo" login option will be provided. This will programmatically log in a pre-defined demo user, allowing access to the application's core features without requiring a full sign-up.

### 5.5 Tab Structure & Implementation Plan
The application will be a Single-Page App (SPA). The following components will be built out and dynamically displayed using Alpine.js.
1.  **Home/Track:** The main view for a logged-in user. Will contain the form to report a match.
2.  **Leaderboard:** A table displaying `Rank`, `Player`, `ELO`, `Wins`, `Losses`, `Win %`. This will be the first component to be made dynamic.
3.  **Matches:** A list/table of the logged-in user's past matches.
4.  **Account:** Displays user info and a logout button.
5.  **Rules:** An interactive "choose your own adventure" style guide.

## 6 · CI/CD with GitHub Actions (New Section)
To ensure code quality, automate deployments, and maintain an active development history, we will implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### 6.1 CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
This workflow will run on every push to the `main` branch.
*   **Trigger:** `on: push, branch: [main]`
*   **Jobs:**
    1.  **Lint & Test:**
        *   Check out the code.
        *   Install Node.js and dependencies (`npm install`).
        *   Run a linter (e.g., ESLint) to enforce code style.
        *   Run any automated tests for the worker.

### 6.2 CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
This workflow will run after the CI workflow succeeds.
*   **Trigger:** `on: workflow_run, workflow: [CI], type: [completed], branch: [main]`
*   **Jobs:**
    1.  **Deploy Worker:**
        *   Check out the code.
        *   Use the official `wrangler-action` to publish the worker.
        *   Requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to be stored in GitHub repository secrets.
    2.  **Deploy Frontend:**
        *   Check out the code.
        *   Use an action to deploy the contents of the `/public` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

    *   Create the `.github/workflows` directory.
    *   Define the `ci.yml` and `deploy.yml` workflow files.
    *   Add required secrets (like `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) to the GitHub repository settings.
2.  **Backend Setup (Supabase & Worker):**
    *   Create a new project in Supabase.
    *   Use the Supabase SQL editor to create the `players` and `matches` tables.
    *   Configure the Cloudflare Worker with Supabase secrets.
    *   Refactor the Worker's `index.ts` to connect to Supabase and implement the revised API endpoints.
3.  **Frontend Implementation (UI & Auth):**
    *   Structure the `index.html` with the five tabs.
    *   Integrate the Supabase.js client library.
    *   Build the UI components for each tab.
4.  **Connecting Frontend & Backend:**
    *   Write the `fetch` logic to call the Worker API with the Supabase JWT.
5.  **Final Polish:**
    *   Finalize styling and ensure mobile responsiveness.

## 8 · Frontend To-Do List (New Section)

A checklist for the frontend development phase.

- [x] **Generate Static Components:**
    - [x] Home/Track (Dashboard Layout)
    - [x] Leaderboard (Full Table)
    - [x] Matches (History List)
    - [x] Account (User Details / Login)
    - [x] Rules (Interactive Guide)
- [x] **Refactor to Alpine.js:**
    - [x] Convert the vanilla JS tab switching and form logic to a unified Alpine.js component.
    - [x] Convert the opponent search and selection to use Alpine.js.
    - [x] Convert the custom radio buttons to use Alpine.js.
- [ ] **Implement Mobile Responsiveness:**
    - [ ] On smaller screens, the right-hand sidebar ("Top 5 Players") should be hidden to save space.
    - [ ] Ensure all tables and forms are legible and usable on a mobile device.
- [x] **Integrate Supabase Auth:**
    - [x] Implement login/signup functionality.
    - [x] Protect tabs/routes that require authentication.
- [x] **Make Components Dynamic:**
    - [x] Fetch and display real data for the Leaderboard and Top 5 Players list.
    - [x] Fetch and display real data for the Matches history.
    - [x] Implement the logic for the "Report a Match" form to submit data to the backend.
- [ ] **Aesthetic Polish & UX (Future Tasks):**
    - [ ] **Layout:**
        - [ ] Fix vertical alignment of tab content to remove the large gap at the bottom (adjust `min-height` on main container).
        - [ ] Ensure text alignment (centered vs. left-aligned) is consistent and intentional across all tabs.
        - [ ] In the Matches tab, add padding to prevent the ELO text from being obscured by the scrollbar.
    - [ ] **Typography:**
        - [ ] Make font sizing more consistent across all components.
        - [ ] Consider a secondary font for headers or accents.
    - [ ] **Animation & Effects:**
        - [ ] Animate the active tab underline so it slides between tabs instead of appearing instantly.
        - [ ] Add a subtle background texture or gradient to the header/body to enhance the theme.
        - [ ] Use `x-transition` to smoothly fade/slide in elements that appear (e.g., the match form).
        - [ ] Implement an idle-screen animation with a bouncing pool ball inside the main container.
    - [ ] **User Experience (UX):**
        - [ ] Make opponent names in the match history clickable links to their profiles/history.
        - [ ] Add loading state indicators (spinners/skeletons) for when data is being fetched. A spinning 8-ball animation would be a great, on-theme option.
        - [ ] Add "empty state" views for components with no data (e.g., a new user's match history).
        - [ ] Implement client-side form validation (e.g., disable submit button until form is complete).

## 9 · Admin Functionality (New Section)

To ensure the league can be managed effectively, a separate, secure admin interface will be developed.

### 9.1 Core Features
*   **Match Management:**
    *   Manually add a match between any two players.
    *   Edit the result of an existing match.
    *   Delete an incorrect or invalid match.
*   **Player Management:**
    *   Adjust a player's ELO rating.
    *   Change a player's username.
    *   Assign or revoke admin privileges for other users.

### 9.2 Technical Implementation
*   **Database:** Add a `role` column (e.g., `TEXT`, with values like 'user' or 'admin') to the `players` table.
*   **Authentication:** Configure Supabase to embed the user's `role` into their JWT upon login. This is known as using "custom claims."
*   **Backend:** Create new, protected API endpoints in the Cloudflare Worker for each admin action (e.g., `PUT /admin/matches/:id`, `DELETE /admin/matches/:id`). These endpoints will validate the JWT and check the user's role before executing.
*   **Frontend:** Create a new, hidden "Admin" tab that is only visible to users with the 'admin' role. This tab will contain the forms and buttons needed to perform the admin actions.
